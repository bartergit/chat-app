# chat-app
Chat app, hosted on heroku. Try this out!  
**First run can be realy slow, like 10 sec or smth, due to serverless functions of Heroku free tier. Be patient!**
Developed with **flask** as server, **svelte** as front-end (javascript library) and **psql** database (pure, without ORM).  
**Socket-io** used on both client and server side to emitting messages.
